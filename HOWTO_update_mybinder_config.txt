1 generate "empty" repository
2 open on mybinder
3 add octave funtionalities:

9 store 'environment.yml' file in all working repositories in binder/environment.yml
10 add postbuild command for jupyterlab-manager ('jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@<correct version>') in binder/postbuild in all working repositories in order to guarantee widgets to work in repositories
